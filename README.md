# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Asadullah Ehsan!

### ðŸŒŸ My Journey: From Enterprise Development to Cutting-Edge Technologies

I started my career as a **Full Stack Engineer**, working with **Angular** and **.NET** to build enterprise-level applications.
Over time, I realized that to stay aligned with emerging trends and maximize my potential, I needed to expand my skills into more modern technologies.

Driven by a desire to expand my expertise and pursue **remote opportunities** and **relocation** to work with global teams, I transitioned to a tech stack that aligns with my passions and future goals. Here's how my journey has evolved:

- **Primary Skills:** I began deep diving into **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** to transition into in-demand technologies.
- **Secondary Skills** I opt for JavaScript mainly now, but since I have spent time with C# and .NET, I know my way around with it.
- **Exploring Web3:** While diving deeper into web development, I discovered **Web3** as an emerging field with growing demand, which piqued my interest.
