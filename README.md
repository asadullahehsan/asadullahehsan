# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Asadullah Ehsan!

### ðŸŒŸ My Journey: From Enterprise Development to Cutting-Edge Technologies

I started my career as a **Full Stack Engineer**, working with **Angular** and **.NET** to build enterprise-level applications.
Over time, I realized that to stay aligned with emerging trends and maximize my potential, I needed to expand my skills into more modern technologies.

Driven by a desire to expand my expertise and pursue **remote opportunities** and **relocation** to work with global teams, I transitioned to a tech stack that aligns with my passions and future goals. Here's how my journey has evolved:

- **Primary Skills:** I began deep diving into **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** to step into in-demand technologies.
- **Secondary Skills** Since I have spent time with C# and .NET initially in my career, I do keep an eye on it too, afterall it is ruling in the enterprise industry.
