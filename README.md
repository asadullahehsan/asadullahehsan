# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Asadullah Ehsan!

### ðŸŒŸ My Journey: From Enterprise Development to Cutting-Edge Technologies

I started my career as a **Full Stack Engineer**, working with **Angular** and **.NET** to build enterprise-level applications.
Over time, I realized that to stay aligned with emerging trends and maximize my potential, I needed to expand my skills into more modern technologies.

Driven by a desire to expand my expertise and pursue **remote opportunities** and **relocation** to work with global teams, I transitioned to a tech stack that aligns with my passions and future goals. Here's how my journey has evolved:

- **Primary Skills:** I began deep diving into **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python** to transition into modern, in-demand technologies.
- **Discovering Full Stack Options:** Primarily, my go to tech stack is **MERN**, **PERN** and **JAM** stacks for full stack **Web2 development**.
- **Exploring Web3:** While diving deeper into web development, I discovered **Web3** as an emerging field with growing demand, which piqued my interest.
- **Serverless Architectures:** Iâ€™m actively learning about **serverless technologies**, and plan to integrate them into my **Web2** and **Web3** projects.
- **AI and LLMs:** For **AI development**, Iâ€™m focused on learning **Python** to work with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and other cutting-edge AI technologies.
